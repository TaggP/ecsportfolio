    <h2>How I Started<h2/>
      <h4><li>I started because my father rowed in college for the Naval Academy. He convinced my two oldest brothers to pick it up eventually leading to me picking it up. My brother was the team captain at the time of 2021 when I first joined. he eventually graduated but I stayed on the team.</li><h4/>
        
        
      <h2> My brother <h2/>
        <h4> My brother was one of my biggest helps when joining rowing. It's not only a hard sport but also can be repetitive at times and my brother helped me get through both those things and the thoughts of quitting. He was a big inspiration and a big reason why I am still on the team. <h4/> 
          
    <h2>Biggest Accomplishment <h2/>

      <h2> History of Rowing <h2/>
        <h4> <p>Rowing originated in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, where it was primarily used for transportation and military purposes. It later became a competitive sport in 18th-century England. The sport gained prominence through college competitions and eventually the Olympics in 1900.</p><h4/>
          
   <h2> How to Play <h2/>
     <h4> Rowing is an odd sport that very little know about if you arent near the coast. Rowing is primarly back and leg muscles and is the act of pulling and pushing an oar through the water in order to propel the boat.
         <li> Races are usually 2km and are based off time of completion </li>
         <li> Events are similar to other racing sports, divided into age category and type of event. </li>
         <li> Each event is based off the amount of people in the boat and wether you are using two or one oar. </li>
         <li> One oar is called sweeping and 2 is called skulling </li>
         <li> A four is a boat with four people with each having one oar while a quad is four people where they both have two oars.</li>
         <ul/>
