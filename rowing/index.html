    <h2>How I Started<h2/>
      <h4><li>I started because my father rowed in college for the Naval Academy. He convinced my two oldest brothers to pick it up eventually leading to me picking it up. My brother was the team captain at the time of 2021 when I first joined. he eventually graduated but I stayed on the team.</li><h4/>
        
        
      <h2> My brother <h2/>
        <h4> My brother was one of my biggest helps when joining rowing. It's not only a hard sport but also can be repetitive at times and my brother helped me get through both those things and the thoughts of quitting. He was a big inspiration and a big reason why I am still on the team. <h4/> 
          
    <h2>Biggest Accomplishment <h2/>
      <h4> 
        <ul>
        <li> I made it to nationals in 2024 and placed 9th in the nation. </li>

      </ul>

      <h2> History of Lacrosse <h2/>
        <h4> <p>Rowing originated in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome, where it was primarily used for transportation and military purposes. It later became a competitive sport in 18th-century England. The sport gained prominence through college competitions and eventually the Olympics in 1900.</p><h4/>
          
   <h2> How to Play <h2/>
     <h4> I play girls lacrosse, which is a little different than boys. We can't hit each other's sticks, only making contact with our hands or body. We also have a less deep stick pocket, making it harder to catch and shoot. But the basic rules are;
       <ul>
         <li> Equipment: Lacrosse Goggles, Mouthguard, Stick </li>
         <li> There is a 12 meter, 8 meter (defenders can only be in here for 3 seconds if they are not on a girl, and crease (Goalie circle that nobody can go into). </li>
         <li> There are 3 sections of the field. Attack, Midfield, and Defensive zones. There are 12 players on the field at a time. Attack can't go into Defense, Defense can't go into attack. Midfielders can go anywhere, anyone can go into the midfield </li>
         <li> No contact with your stick, only your hands and body </li>
         <li> 12-inch invisible "sphere" around each girl's head that nobody can put their stick in</li>
         <li> If there is a foul, girls can shoot from the 8 meters </li>
         <ul/>
         <h4/>
